For my final degree project I decided to create a reading typeface, that not only was guided by its aesthetical value, but also its utilitary in daily life. The aim of this font is to be extremely readible by people with low vision problems such as astigmatism, myopia, presbyopia...

My personal motivation was to find a way to use design to help people. Reading is something we do every day in ourl lifes, and making it easier will help us have a more relaxed and simple life.

You can use this font in commercial and personal use. Crediting is not mandatory, but its appreciated!
